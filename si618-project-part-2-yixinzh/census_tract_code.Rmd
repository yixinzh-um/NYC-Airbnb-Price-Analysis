## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(tigris)
library(tidyverse)
listings <- read.csv('data/listings.csv')
test<-listings[1:100,]

```
```{r}

```

```{r}
listings %>% 
  group_by(room_type) %>% 
  summarize(count=n())
```



```{r}
test<-listings %>% 
  filter(neighbourhood_group_cleansed=='Manhattan', room_type=='Entire home/apt',accommodates==2) 

test%>% 
  nrow()

lat = test$latitude
lon = test$longitude
test$census_code <-mapply(call_geolocator_latlon, lat = lat, lon = lon)

```

```{r}
test$census_code
```
```{r}
write.csv(test,'listing_census_code.csv')
```
